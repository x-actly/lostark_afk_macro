# lostark_afk_macro

This is a simple Lost Ark Afk Macro to farm collectibles from named bosses in the Open World.
Before you start, stay close to a named boss location, change Game to Windowed Mode, start script
and follow the instruction in the command promt window.

The script is written in Python 3.10 with modules time, random, pyautogui and keyboard.
Install pyautogui and keyboard with Windows command prompt:
  
pip install pyautogui
pip install keyboard


main.py contains an example script to loop the macro function in functions.py.
comment out specific macros in functions.py if you dont need them.

Btw.... i have implemented the random.uniform function to make the inputs more human... but this is no garantee to be safe.
Do not stay 24/7 on any Farm Location, there is a high chance to get reported.
